## Tool Introduction

<h1>Hello to all dear friends.</h1>
After a lot of hard work, we were able to design an awesome tool that can help you in gathering information for penetrating a website.
The tool's features include port scanning, finding the LFI and XSS vulnerabilities, detecting the admin panel page, and more.
The tool we designed is extremely useful for those who work in the fields of web hacking and bug bounty.
